Your mission: Create a GENUINE, SAFE scenario where there's NO THREAT and the user should act NORMALLY. This is a test to see if they're being paranoid! Do not give any hints that it is genuine.

${titleHistoryText}${recentThemesText}

ðŸŽ¯ GENUINE SCENARIO PHILOSOPHY:
- Create a perfectly legitimate situation (concert tickets, job opportunities, friend messages, etc.)
- Make it something they would WANT to engage with
- Include realistic details
- Do not give tips like "official", "genuine", or "trusted"
- It should be ${level}/3 difficult to identify as genuine
- The "correct" action is to engage normally and enjoy the opportunity

ðŸŽ® TARGET AUDIENCE: 
Highschool girls from European countries (14-18 years old)

GENUINE SCENARIO THEMES (MUST ROTATE - Make each one unique):
Concert tickets, festival passes, movie premieres, gaming tournaments, streaming events
Scholarship opportunities, internship offers, university programs, skill-building courses, mentorship programs  
Real friend messages, group chat invitations, photo sharing, event planning, study groups
Legitimate sales from known brands, student discounts, seasonal promotions, loyalty programs
Genuine app updates, new feature announcements, legitimate software upgrades, platform migrations
Fitness challenges, mental health resources, nutrition programs, meditation apps, wellness communities
Art workshops, book clubs, photography contests, music lessons, creative challenges
Student travel programs, exchange opportunities, local event discoveries, adventure clubs
Legitimate banking features, student account offers, budgeting tools, financial literacy programs
Real game updates, legitimate DLC releases, community events, streaming platform features

ðŸŽ¯ DIVERSITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Make each scenario feel completely different from previous ones
- Focus on opportunities Belgian teenagers would genuinely want
- Include realistic details that make engagement appealing
- Vary the communication method (text, email, app notification, etc.)
- Create FOMO (fear of missing out) for legitimate opportunities
- Should be ${level}/3 MISLEADING to identify from the following list of threats:
1. **Password & Authentication Attacks**: Credential stuffing, password breaches, 2FA bypass attempts, account takeover scenarios
2. **Social Engineering Beyond Phishing**: Pretexting phone calls, fake tech support, impersonation attacks, psychological manipulation
3. **Network & WiFi Security**: Evil twin networks, man-in-the-middle attacks, public WiFi dangers, router hijacking
4. **Mobile & App Security**: Fake apps, permission abuse, SMS hijacking, mobile malware, app store scams
5. **IoT & Smart Device Threats**: Smart home hacking, camera hijacking, voice assistant abuse, device botnet recruitment
6. **AI & Deepfake Deception**: Voice cloning scams, deepfake videos, AI-generated content, chatbot manipulation
7. **Privacy & Data Harvesting**: Location tracking, data broker threats, digital stalking, metadata exposure
8. **Financial & Crypto Scams**: Investment frauds, fake trading platforms, crypto wallet attacks, payment app scams
9. **Gaming & Entertainment Threats**: Game account theft, streaming platform hacks, fake gaming deals, esports scams
10. **Educational & Career Scams**: Fake internships, scholarship frauds, fake online courses, academic phishing
11. **Shopping & E-commerce Attacks**: Fake stores, payment skimming, fake reviews, counterfeit goods
12. **Healthcare & Personal Data**: Medical identity theft, fake health apps, prescription scams, fitness tracker exploitation

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):

${titleHistoryText}${recentThemesText}

ðŸŽ¯ SCENARIO DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
- Make it RELATABLE but DEADLY - situations they'll actually face
- Make it increasingly harder as the game progresses
- Level 0 should be very easy, Level 3 should be nearly impossible and require extreme specificity
- Hide traps within traps - multiple layers of deception  
- Demand LASER PRECISION - only cybersecurity ninjas survive
- Make failure HILARIOUS but educational

- Include modern threats they actually encounter
- Make each scenario feel completely different

ðŸŽ® LEVEL PROGRESSION GUIDE:
- Level 1: Single attack vector, obvious red flags

- Level 3: Advanced persistent threats, nearly impossible to detect

ðŸŽª TONE REQUIREMENTS:
- DRAMATIC and fun

- Reference pop culture they'll recognize
- Make the stakes feel PERSONAL and urgent
